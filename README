Knockout Live Plugin

Files:
- knockout.live.plugin.js on the client
- server.js running on node server

Dependencies:
- Knockout HEAD
- Socket.io client
- Node.js and socket.io on the server side

Steps to see it happen:
- Clone the repo
- Run "node server.js"
- Point your browser to localhost:8080

What do you need for your application to go "live"?:
- Start a simple node server with the server.js included in this project(modify it as you desire)
- Set .live(object_tree_string) on all ko.observable() and ko.observableArray() you want to synchronize remotely(see the chat example)
- Run ko.utils.socketConnect(address,port) before ko.applyBindings()

TODO:
- Adapter interface for sync options besides socket.io
- Handle complex observable objects
